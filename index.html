      <h3>A little about me </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="para">
      <p>Let’s get acquainted! My name is William Lalonde, and I’ve always been interested
        in 2 main things, wildlife and the behind-the-scenes of games. I would often
        spend my time either learning about animals or learning ways to break my
        favorite game for fun.<br><br>
        Because of one of those key interests, I would often show
        my friends the interesting ways I broke games ranging from Mario Sunshine to
        Valhiem. This led to me testing games for friends, finding strange oversights that
        allowed for all the wrong things, to help them find possible solutions in C++, C#.
        Enrolling into a Game Programming course was the next logical step, so I did just
        that at St.Laurence College. I’m already in my final year!

        <br><br>Some may say that programming is extremely frustrating from time to time,
        but that's not how I see it; the challenge is what I enjoy about it.
        Finding the solution to a problem that’s had me stumped is comparable to
        winning against a friend at his own game.
        Upon graduation in May, I plan on joining the game industry as a QA junior or a programmer junior.

        Week 2 of the capstone project was mostly set up for the project still. The project being a 2d platformer with fast paced movement, that promotes the player to go faster and faster. The gameplay of the game will be a mashup of Cup head and
        Ori and the blind forest. Now that we (the group) now know what kind of game to make, let’s talk about our process.<br><br>

        Monday<br>
        We started that class by touching up the GDD (Game Design Documents) by listing to the professors’ inputs that he previously left on it. A good portion of those comments provided told us to clarify details. Working on the GDD ended reassuring
        me since Pamela, Hyangsu and Kaleb started giving their input. During the previous week getting a response from Pamela, Hyangsu or Kaleb was rare occurrence, making the class boring.<br><br>

        Thursday<br>
        This class the group worked on their respective TDD (Technical design document). These document are made to create a easier work flow during the creating of the game. In a TDD there is normally 5 parts, a quick description of what your
        making, technical challenges that your going to encounter, UML diagram which breaks down the necessary class with their properties, Flow chart which helps developers have a understanding of how the thing works and a task list which breaks
        down the necessary tasks needed to make the thing.


        While the group was working on the TDD, I was making the Jira webhook.
        The purpose of this webhook was to notify the group in discord every time the Kanban board was updated. This seemed easy like a project that shouldn’t take a lot of time to make, and it is if you’re the admin of the Kanban board. If you
        couldn’t guess, I wasn’t, this made a quick 20 minute learning process into an 1 hour process. Normally to make a webhook all you needed to do was, make a webhook bot in discord under the webhook tab and copy its URL. Then slap that URL into
        https://skyhook.glitch.me/ and modify it to suit your need. Then finally go to your Jira under the webhook tab and paste the URL in the URL tab with the capability you want enabled.<br><br>

        Without Administration you can’t get into the discord or Jira webhook tabs. This took longer than I like to admit figure out, but in the end it works.<br><br>

      <p> Week 3 was a revision week; everyone was finishing up their respective TDD. Hyangsu was finishing up the saving system TDD, Kaleb was finishing up the UI TDD, Nolan was finishing up the combat TDD , Pamela was finishing up the audio TDD,
        and I was finishing up the AI/Mobs TDD. <br><br>

        Monday<br>
        For Monday’s work period, I finished my TDD, and ended up trouble shooting the GitHub Webhook with Nolan. The issue at hand was the fact that he could download from the git repository but could not upload anything to it. Turns out the issue
        was that git defaulted the branch to master when you download from it for the first time. The reason why that’s an issue, is because we don’t have a master branch in our repository. So, when Nolan tries to upload to the repository it would
        look for a non-existing branch. The fix for it was simple, just run the “git checkout main”, this would change the branch of the local repository to master (an existing branch).<br><br>

        Thursday<br>
        Thursday quick day, it was a snowstorm, so the group wanted to get the work done and get home before the roads get worse than it already was. We couldn’t work from home since the files that we needed (the TDD) was on the school’s computers…
        Either way Thursday, the group went around reviewing everyone’s TDD. At the end of the review, I don’t think anyone had to critiqued anything. I’m not sure if its because none of us felt comfortable to critiquing each other’s work or because
        everyone’s TDD was superb. Must be the latter, since the groups TDD’s did indeed look good.<br><br>

        With the TDD’s essentially finished, next week is when we start working on the game. Week 4 is going to be the group’s first sprint. Sprint being a time-boxed period where the team completes a set amount of work. I look forward to this, since
        now we will finally be able to start making the game.<br><br>

      <p>
        Week 4 is the official start of “game making” for the group, since everyone can now actually start implementing things for the projects. This week I ended up playing with A* algorithm and scriptable objects. A* being an pathfinding algorithm
        that finds the most efficient path for something to take and scriptable objects being a good method for information holding and manipulating.<br><br>

        Monday<br>
        Even though I said at the top that we started implementing things, that wasn’t the case for Monday. Monday Nolan, Pamela and Hyangsu were writing up a “battle plan” for this sprint(sprint is a pre-determined time period with set goals to
        achieve). While they were working away at that, I was helping Kaleb apply the professors’ suggestions to his TD. Turns out there was no need to apply the professors’ suggestions grading wise, but I’m sure that doing so will help with the
        process of the projects.<br><br>

        Wednesday<br>
        This class started off with the professor presenting a video about good tutorials. With the time that was left, I worked on created and stubbing out the base class, and the inheriting classes for the mobs. I did this to be able to create
        enemies in an easier manner. This turned out to not be case, because of my lack of understanding of how classes work in unity compared to c++.<br><br>

        Thursday<br>
        Thursday was all about pathfinding. Since I didn’t know anything about path finding I was following a tutorial by Brackeys about this subject. This introduced me to A* and how to use it. About 30 minutes after I now had flying mobs tracking
        down the player.
        With mods that can now track the player down I wanted to be able to have different version of it and asked the professor what the best way would be to do so, he brought scriptable objects.<br><br>

        Weekend<br>
        Over the weekend I ended up starting over with the enemy. No longer using different class such as BaseMob,GroundMob and AirMob. Instead I have scriptable objects that hold basic info(health,speed,dmg) about a mob and intake the pathfinding
        method(ground,air) that I desire. The next step in my plan now is the get my enemies to attack the player in different ways.<br><br>

      <p>
        At the end of this week, we created a working prototype. Everyone ended up finishing what they were assigned with little to no problems. The prototype allows the player to run, jump, parry and kill mobs and it even has a boss in place.
        <br><br>

        Monday<br>
        Monday was mostly just me trouble shooting how to get the mobs to “think” and I do mean more than to track down the player. For example, one of the mobs I ended up making will track the player down and starting shooting bullets at the player.
        This mob however will stay at a safe range from the player, if the player is too far away, it will run towards them, if the distance is just right, it will shoot, and if the player is too close, it will run away.<br><br>

        While working on the mobs, I originally thought that ground mobs were going to be easier to work on compared to air mobs… This so far was the biggest misunderstanding I’ve encountered thus far. Since for ground mobs there are multiple checks
        that have to be done to insure that they stay on the ground.<br><br>

        Wednesday/ Thursday<br>
        These work periods were mostly trouble shooting and tweaking things with Nolan. The first issue was the parry mechanic wasn’t working the way the programmed suggested. The player could parry off of bullets, but it would never turn off the
        canParry bool after parrying off of it. Since canParry gets disabled OnTriggerExit but the bullet would get destroyed when the player touched it, this would never activate OnTriggerExit. The work around we found was to teleport the bullet
        just before it got destroyed. I’m not really happy about this fix but it doesn’t really matter since for the prototype we removed the parry-able bullets. Another fix was the BasicGround Mob, it was originally using a Ray to detect if it was
        grounded but turns out the ray I used was bugged, so as a replacement I “borrowed” Nolan’s ground check for the player.<br><br>

        Friday<br>
        Friday was a more relaxed day since all I did was make a prototype level for the prototype that included the mobs. <br><br>

        Since the protype is finished, that means that the main concept of the game is also done. With that being the case, the majority of the work now, are touchups, such as how the gameplay feels, how the levels feel and visuals. Just saying
        visuals is kind of downplaying how much work that really is, visuals really mean things like animation, mob art, player art, particles, art of the levels, background art, decorations, etc... There are a lot of things that still need to be
        made. That’s why this week I started playing with particles.<br><br>

        The first particle I made when working on particles was player running particles. So, I made a unity particles component and was lost. There was a lot more options and sliders then I was expecting. Instead of playing with it for a while and
        trying to brute force what I wanted, I search up a tutorial by Brackeys to gain a understanding of the system.
        <br><br>
        With a better understanding, I was able to create a “dust” particles that emitted from player when he ran. Even thought it did what I wanted I felt that maybe less was better, so I decided to change when the particles was played. Instead of
        the dust being played when the player ran I made it so that it played when jumped and turned direction on the ground. The main things that makes the particles work is that the dust simulation space was the world and not local, allowing it to
        float where it spawned.
        <br><br>
        The next particles I played with the mob death particles, here I wanted something little strange. I made it so that when the mob would die it would spawn a puff of particles that the player would push aside when flying threw the mob. The only
        issue with all of this, was the fact that I mimicked the way I did the player particles. So the particles was child of mob, so when the mob would get destroyed the particles would also disappear. The fix was to create a prefab of the
        particles, spawn it in when the mob dies and destroy it after the particle’s lifetime is over.
        <br><br>
        The most complicated effect I made this week was the “fade” effect. When the player would have a combo of 3 or higher, there would be a trail of after images of the player that appears. This isn’t even using the particles system. When the
        player reaches a combo of 3 it spawns in a prefabs of the player model that has a animation attached to it, that animation being a fade away. After the fade is done it destroys itself. Leaving behind a neat little effect.
